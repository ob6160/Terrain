# Independent Project 2019/20 - "Generating and manipulating procedural terrain"
An exploration of different techniques used in the generation of realistic terrain and their implementation.

## Project as of 2019/12/03
![Project Demo](demo_1.png)

## Topics of Interest

* Rendering techniques (vertices, raymarching etc)
* Lighting
* Texturing
* Tiling terrain (infinite scroll)
* Level of Detail
* Erosion
* Mouse picking & terrain manipulation

## Technology Used
